# ASDKPlaceholderTest
Working on some content placeholder views using AsyncDisplayKit.

I'm currently trying to get my placeholder cell node to take on a manually-controllable size and center its content inside there. That way I can look at the screen and the headers and everything, and set the placeholder cell size correctly.
